    \subsection{Principle Involved in the mechanism}
        The kinetic energy of piston of air cylinder along with the potential energy of kicking link is converted
        into rotational energy of kicking link which is finally converted to the kinetic energy of the ball.

    \subsection{Design Calculations}
        o The calculation for angular travel of the hitting part of mechanism actuated using pneumatic air cylinder (Fig 3).                    \\
        o In angular travel calculation, we are tracingan arc travelled by rod end bearing at the endpoint ofthe piston rod.                    \\
            \textbf{A:} Initial position of the endpoint of the piston rod.                                                                     \\
            \textbf{B:} The endpoint of the piston rod.                                                                                         \\
            \textbf{C:} The pivot point of kicking link.                                                                                        \\
            \textbf{D:} The pivot point of an air cylinder.                                                                                     \\
        o Steps in calculations and deciding the height of pivot for air cylinder and the distance between 2 pivots:                            \\
            \textbf{1.} Considering the length of the kicking part, an arc is drawn with centre at c with some clearance from the ground.    \\
            \textbf{2.} For a given cylinder, 90 0 angular travel of the hitting part is preferred to impart maximum force and velocity 
                        to the kickball. \textbf{Angular travel more than 90 0 is not preferred since for that particular angle, piston 
                        motion inside air cylinder is restricted.}                                                                           \\
            \textbf{3.} A vertical line passing through centre C is drawn, ensuring a $30 \degree$ angle in forwarding \textbf{((B)} and
                        a $60 \degree$ angle in the backward direction \textbf{(ponit A)}.                                                   \\    
            \textbf{4.} Considering the retracted position of the piston of the air cylinder, an arc taking \textbf{(A} as a centre with
                        the length of retracted position (425 mm) is drawn. Again, extended length (725 mm) of the piston in air cylinder
                        is taken into consideration to draw an arc with centre at B. The point of intersection of these 2 is point D which
                        is actually the pivot point of the air cylinder.                                                                     \\
 

    \subsection{Working}
        Two pneumatic air cylinders are mounted on the top of the \textbf{support structure} and are connected to the leg. Initially, the 
        piston of the air cylinder is retracted and is connected to the kicking link with the help of a rod end bearing. Just after the robot
        aligns itself at the required distance, the kick is initialized by actuating \textbf{5/2 direction control solenoid valve} and as soon
        as it gets extended, as per the principle, the kicking link travels an angular arc and finally hits the ball.
