%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    \subsection{Type Of Drive}
        The drive used for the locomotion of the robot is a \textbf{three-wheel holonomic drive} made using \textbf{Omni wheels}. Three-wheel Omni drive is 
        used because of its simplicity, agility and ease of control. It is made using \textbf{Aluminium 6061 square tubes} because of its optimum 
        strength to weight ratio. For automating the three-wheel we have used an \textbf{Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) MPU6050} which allows 
        the robot to orient itself. For the distances feedback, we have used encoders with dummy wheels to \textbf{resolve locomotion along X and 
        Y-axis}.
